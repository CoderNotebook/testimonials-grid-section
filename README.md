# testimonials-grid-section

The project was created on the basis of a task/challenge which can be found at this link: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7/hub

It was created using the BEM methodology and I also used preprocessor sass.

The code is written to test and use all available functionalities in scss. So it is not of the best quality :D
